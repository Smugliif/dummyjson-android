# dummyjson-android application

This is a simple android Jetpack Compose application that interacts with the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/). It simulates the POST, PUT and DELETE API calls and displays data from the API using GET requests. All API calls happen using [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/).
